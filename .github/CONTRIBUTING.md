# Contributing to SummitShare

We're thrilled that you're interested in contributing to the SummitShare project! This guide outlines how you can offer suggestions, document your code, and submit your contributions to help improve the platform. - note this is a work in progress so if you do have suggestions on how to go about contributions we are open to your suggestions.

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Explore Current Issues**: Begin by browsing the [current issues](https://github.com/SummitShare/SummitShare-Client/issues) on our GitHub repository. If you find an unassigned issue you're interested in solving, you can start working on it.
   
2. **Forking and Naming**: Fork the repository and name your fork according to the issue you're addressing, making it easier for the team to track contributions.

3. **Pull Requests (PRs)**: Once you've completed your work, open a pull request against the main repository. Include a clear and detailed PR description outlining the changes and the issue it resolves.

4. **Email the Building Team**: Optionally, you can email the building team at [summitshare.eth@gmail.com](mailto:summitshare.eth@gmail.com) with the issue name in the subject line and a link to your PR. This is especially useful for discussing larger changes or proposals not already listed as issues.

## 📬 Proposing Changes

If you have a suggestion that could improve the project but isn't currently listed as an issue, we welcome your initiative!

- **Email Your Proposal**: Send your suggestion to [summitshare.eth@gmail.com](mailto:summitshare.eth@gmail.com), including a detailed explanation of the proposed change and its value to the project.
- **Approval Process**: The building team will review your proposal. We may approve it, request modifications, or deny it based on its alignment with the project's goals. If approved, you're encouraged to proceed with implementing the change.

## 📝 Documentation Guidelines

Clear and concise documentation is key to maintaining and understanding the project. Here’s how to document your code contributions:

### Component Category and Purpose

At the beginning of each file, use a structured comment to specify the component's category and purpose. For example:

```javascript
/* Category: Admin Dashboard
   Purpose: Revenue Distribution */
```

### Function Level Documentation

Each function should be accompanied by a concise comment describing its purpose in a single line. For example:

```javascript
// Signs in the user and redirects to the signIn page
const handleClickSignIn = () => {
  router.push("/auth/signIn");
}
```

## 🏷️ Using Tags in Emails

When emailing the building team, please include relevant tags in the subject line (e.g., `[Issue Name]`, `[Proposal]`, `[PR Request]`) to help us sort and address your messages efficiently.

## 💡 Feedback and Questions

If you have any questions or feedback about the contribution process, don't hesitate to reach out via GitHub issues or email. We value your input and are here to support your contributions to the SummitShare project.
